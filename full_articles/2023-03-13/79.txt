The event is expected to attract over 100 promising Web3 projects, communities and media, more than 10,000 attendees, as well as leading venture capitals, presenting content-rich discussions and topics centered around Web3. Hong Kong regulatory representatives will also dive into and interpret the latest digital asset regulation policies.

Web3 Festival will offer all attendees an opportunity to learn the cutting-edge technology, inspiring opinions, trending topics and infrastructural solutions of Web3. At the event, top VC firms in the industry will explore the Web3 trends and seek investment in promising projects, providing support for young Web3 talents and start-up teams. Additionally, regulatory representatives are also invited to introduce Hong Kong Government’s latest regulatory policies and the way forward for the Web3 and virtual asset industry. This will hopefully help Web3 projects ponder a move to Hong Kong to have a better understanding of the opportunities, challenges, talent pool, education resources and favorable policies here. Today, Web3 is booming, with new categories demonstrating great market potential. We hope that Web3 Festival could provide an enabling start-up platform for outstanding talents around the world and spark more enthusiasm for innovation.
