Welcome to this game update🤗! We have made some optimizations and we hope that this update will provide you with a more enjoyable gaming experience. We are constantly working to improve the game in order to provide players with better experiences and more challenges. Let’s explore together!👀

There are some updates coming to Tiny Kingdom on 📅**30/03/2023 08:00 UTC**📅 as follows:

1. **PVP Arena Official Launch🤼**
PVP arena beta version was released on March 16th. During the beta testing period, we optimized some functions based on players’ feedback to provide a better gaming experience. Thanks to your help, the arena beta test will end this Thursday. **We will release the official version after the end of the beta period** according to our plans. So stay tuned🤩!

2. **Leaderboard Rewards Adjustment🏆**

The [leaderboard rewards proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/tinygames.eth/proposal/0xb293cfdd9211603cfb45f3811aa724f13e1688f38e3b27657a4430f94e129d19) has been updated, the voting period is from **Mar. 28th 07:00 UTC to Mar. 29 10:00 UTC**. Rewards will be distributed based on the results of the players’ votes!

3. **VeTINC Corresponding Title Adjustment👑**

According to the DAO voting results of the 6th proposal for veTINC adjustment, the maximum lock-up period for DAO staking will be extended to 2 years. This means 2 veTINC will be rewarded when locking 1 TINC for 2 years. Meanwhile, the amount of veTINC required for in-game titles will be automatically adjusted based on the 72-hour TINC average price, with the demand multiplier being adjusted accordingly.

4. **Tinymon Regrowth System Release🔄️**

With the opening of the arena, players have a stronger need for Tinymon change. **The Tinymon regrowth function will reset an upgraded Tinymon’s body part to the original status, and return 80% in Tinymon experience potions.** Tinymon experience potions help upgrade Tinymon’s body part experience.

Along with the opening of the Tinymon regrowth function, there are two other adjustments:

➡️A. **Tinymon trades will not keep body part levels.**

In order to ensure the stable development of the Tiny Kingdom ecosystem and the normal circulation of materials in the trading market, after the Tinymon regrowth system is launched, the Tinymon will no longer keep its body part level after being traded. Therefore, you can recycle their level-up costs through the regrowth function before withdrawing your Tinymon.

➡️B. **Tinymon material consumption will not have any restrictions for material quality.**

Tinymon material consumption enhances the corresponding body part experience. After the Tinymon regrowth system is launched, the minimum quality requirement for Tinymon material consumption will be eliminated for different quality parts.

Thank you for your attention and support. We will continue to work hard to bring players a better gaming experience. We wish you a fun time in Tiny Kingdom and look forward to meeting you again in the game🥰.
