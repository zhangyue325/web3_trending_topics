1. What are industry pain points?
![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202303/3851c19527a2e3542fc5855749639823.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70)Web3Port’s Network has three types of roles:

* Startups
* Service Providers (*VCs, FA, DEXss/CEX, market makers, code auditors, marketing agencies, media, legal advice, etc.)*
* Community Contributors (*end users, influencers, developers, etc.)*
All of them have different requirements for further development.

* Startups need kinds of professional and dedicated services to help them develop from 0 to 1.
* Service providers want to grab enough clients and generate stable cashflows.
* Community contributors hope to have more channels to collect useful information and get rewards.
However, in the era of Web3, these participants still use primitive and isolated solutions, which is low-efficient, unscalable, and unsustainable.

In fact, they can work together and run efficiently, rather than get stuck in a prisoner’s dilemma or Zero-sum Game.

Therefore, Web3Port would like to help these participants have a balanced relationship.

2.How to remove industry pain points?

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202303/43e29e2aeb2c4e3c5265a6e2aed28e4b.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70)1) Web3Port will develop a series of tool modules to meet the demands of Startups, Service Providers, and Community Contributors.

2) These tools will realize peer-to-peer matching to connect Web3Port participants.

The network is a user network that links the supply and demand of the participating roles using toolkits and incentivizes participants for their contributions.

3) Web3Port will leverage the increasing connection network to improve the Data+AI model and facilitate more efficient matching of demand and supply.

The Data+AI module processes data using AI tools, provides more efficient matching of demand and supply, including AI data recommendations, smart matching, smart marketing, business/investment analysis and decision-making.

4)Web3Port will open the permissions to develop various tools, build the network with communities, and develop a decentralized Connection Protocol.

3. Revenue & Token

4. Web3Port Timelines and Milestones

![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202303/0ec5a123298ba790aa1d3dc7e5e76aea.png?x-oss-process=style/scale70)So far Web3Port APP has 9 features, 50k on-chain interactions, 10K+end users, 200+ startups (business users), and 500+ contributors.

In 2023 Web3Port continues to work on the tool modules’ closed beta test and public release, expands the connection network, implements a series of incentive programs to onboard contributors, and occupies a market share of scale based on efficient marketing strategies.

Next, efforts will be put on Launchpad development, user persona, project persona, smart marketing, and other basic features of the Data + AI module.

Above are Web3Port’s track records and future plans. In 2023 we are looking forward to working with more startups and consumers to dive deep into the Web3 world.
