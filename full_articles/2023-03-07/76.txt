The team has been hard at work constructing the soulbound SPIRIT NFT.

You can exchange your Tiny Hero for soulbound SPIRIT. Soulbound SPIRIT cannot be traded or sent to another wallet or to Tiny Kingdom, it is bound to your account. Users will be able to utilise soulbound SPIRIT to replenish energy, increase Hero power and Tinymon breeding.

Users will get the amount of SPIRIT according the class of NFT they submit during the event period. The team will release an exchange chart so that you can easily view the SPIRIT returned for your Tiny Hero!

All NFTs exchanged during the event will be burned!
