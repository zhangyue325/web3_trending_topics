Description: Litra is creating deep NFT liquidity using advanced union curves and veToken models to provide NFT liquidity-as-a-service and empower NFT pricing. To address the low liquidity of the NFT market, the Litra protocol turns NFT into a standard asset, increasing its price accuracy by locking NFT into the protocol and casting the corresponding wrapped NFT (ERC-20). With automatic centralized liquidity and custom co-curve features, not only do liquidity providers reduce their erratic losses, but traders also benefit from extremely low slippage.
