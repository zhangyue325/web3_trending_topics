#### **New Product Spoiler**

What’s the trend：AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) represents the cutting-edge application and exploration of AI technology. From traditional internet to web3, there are ongoing explorations of ways in which AI can replace humans or collaborate with humans to produce content.

What’s the problem：

1. AI assisted creation can lead to loss of control over the conversation and off-topic ideas.
2. Lack of creativity and originality: AIGC is good at generating content based on patterns and rules, but it still lacks the creativity and originality that human writers and artists possess.
3. Limited ability to understand context and emotions: AIGC algorithms can struggle to understand the nuances of language and human emotions, which can result in inaccurate or inappropriate content.
What do we think:we aim to convey the message while also making the final piece more artistic and playful.
