The event will be in sync with the “Hong Kong International Innovation and Technology Exhibition (InnoEX)” co-sponsored by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC), and together with other activities to form the “Innovation and Technology Business Week (BITWEEK)”.

Lennix Lai, Managing Director of Global Institutional at OKX, said: “We’re pleased to be title sponsor of the Hong Kong Web3 Festival 2023, an event that will bring together the best talents and brightest minds in Web3 to Hong Kong, a place that is once again surging to the forefront of Asia’s technology and innovation scene. OKX is committed to the development of Web3 in Hong Kong, and we are looking forward to engaging with people from all over the world who will be attending the conference.”

The meaning and scope of “cryptocurrency” has shifted significantly since its inception. Today, the term “crypto” generally encompasses a broader definition of digital assets that form a digital asset ecosystem powered by decentralised and encryption technology. In the Web3 era, a robust digital asset ecosystem depends on secure and reliable financial infrastructure, such as digital wallets and decentralised identity (DID) technology. Blockchain technology, as the core underlying technology of Web3, facilitates the implementation of DID technology to prevent disputes and maintains data reliability at a lower cost.

The Hong Kong Web3 Festival 2023 includes five venues with an area of nearly 9,000 square meters. It is expected to attract more than 10,000 on-site participants, more than 300 globally influential speakers, and more than 100 promising Web3 projects, communities and media. Regular tickets for the event are on sale — please go to the official website of the event (www.web3festival.org) to purchase.
