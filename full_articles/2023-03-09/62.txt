Thank you so much for your attention and anticipation of PVP arena. We are excited to announce that the **BETA version** will be launched on 📅**16/03/2023📅**, and you will be able to experience the excitement and competition. In the previous two weeks, we introduced the gameplay and battle details of PVP arena. Now, it’s time for the most exciting part — let’s learn about the arena rewards together😝.

1. **Arena Points🔢**

* User **arena points start at 1000** at the beginning of each season. You can increase your arena points by participating in arena challenges. When you win your arena points increase, but when you lose they decrease. Furthermore, if you are challenged and lose, your arena points will be reduced.
* **Arena points are currently the ONLY value that affects daily rewards and seasonal rewards**. We will consider adding other reward categories in the future to supplement the arena season content to provide a more exciting game experience to you guys.
2. **Daily Rewards🏆**

* The daily ranking is determined by the points obtained during the day’s battles. In the case multiple players obtain the same score, the higher rank will be given to the player that obtained their points first. The deductions for losing battles will **NOT** count on the leaderboard. The reward will be **SPIRIT**.
3. **Season Rewards💰**

* **Each season lasts for 7 days**. At the end of the season, the ranking rewards will be given out based on the total arena points, and the reward will be **TINC**.
* The arena season rewards will be the most attractive rewards in Tiny kingdom. In addition to a large amount of TINC rewards, we will also provide more rare rewards with the upcoming Kingdom treasure system.
We hope this information will help you better understand the arena reward system. Thank you for your support and attention, and we look forward to fighting with you in the arena😝! Let us all look forward to the arena’s BETA release!💪
