— — Presented by Jimmy Yin, co-founder of iZUMi Finance

Hello friends, this is Jimmy, the co-founder of iZUMi Finance. I’m honoured to be here today and deliver my speech with the title of “Accessible On-chain Orderbook Trading”, to give you a brief walkthrough our latest product “iZiSwap Pro”

First, let’s take a look back on the DEX sector in the past year of 2022, and the rationale behind the concept of iZiSwap Pro.

Centralized financial institutions in Web3 went far against “decentralization” — the spirit of blockchain technology. Their opacity facilitates the conduct of fund misappropriation, data falsification, and price manipulation, which significantly increased the systemic risk of the industry.

The bull run in 2021 definitely brought in a huge flow of on-chain users. There are more assets and users’ on-chain activities which deserve on-chain trading. The booming growth of on-chain applications such as Gamefi and NFT also brings more demand for users to trade on-chain. Meanwhile fundamental techs make less gas fee and higher speed.

In a thriving ecosystem, we expect that the number of active DEX users will continue to grow.

Fundamental techs make less gas fee and higher speed. AMM is improving itself in capital efficiency against CEX.

1. New narratives instead of liquidity mining evolve, unique features+high APR+easy access are brought to the retails
2. DEX being the first stop for fresh assets. DEX with good operation and services will eat the shares of long-tail CEX markets
3. Make reasonable profits as a lasting business, SAAS business model
We, iZUMi Finance, proposed the first AMM-driven orderbook DEX, called iZiSwap Pro.

iZiSwap Pro introduced an orderbook-styled UI/UX, with unified account, being gasless and cost-efficient, censorship-resistant, and more importantly, non-custodial & transparent.

iZiSwap Pro has NO slippage and front-run attacks compared to other AMM DEX. Users can buy or sell their token at exact price with limit order and enjoy the same UI/UX as orderbook exchange.

iZiSwap Pro also has its unique features,

* DID and ”missile airdrop”
* AA (Account Abstraction) for gasless trading
* Shared liquidity for spot/margin/option
* No-impermanent-loss Farming
The user experience of iZiSwap Pro is similar to CEX in trading experience, UI design, and liquidity efficiency, but without any artificial rug-pulls.

* For Projects, iZiSwap Pro provides free listing and Automated Market Making
* For Traders, iZiSwap Pro provides Limit order & orderbook trading experience just like CEX
* For LPs, iZiSwap Pro is non-custodial and risk-free from cross-chain bridge, 100% safe
* For MMs, iZiSwap Pro allows them to enjoy the concentrated liquidity and hyper capital efficiency for them earn more fees
With all the user-centric and innovative designs, we hope high-performance public chains can enjoy the benefits of our frontier infrastructure.
