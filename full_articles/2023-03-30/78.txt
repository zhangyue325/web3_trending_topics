This SDK test is certainly a good opportunity for MetaOasis Lab, which has successfully incubated 5 game studios and is always looking for quality young projects, to meet new quality projects.

Therefore, with the intention of helping with more excellent web3 projects, MetaOasis Lab’s assessment team also conducted very detailed and in-depth research on all the projects that signed up for the SDK test.

We aim to discover and incubate more high-quality web3 projects, therefore contributing to the growth of the web3 ecosystem and advancing the field.

Strictly following our incubation process and also based on the professional six-dimensional radar chart, the MetaOasis Lab team agreed that the projects enrolled in the SDK were of very high quality.

SoonSwap, an NFT platform, increases the revenue of holders by improving the liquidity of NFT. DuDuLab already has a large community and a very loyal group of users!

We are glad to have these projects, and we believe all of us will contribute to the optimization of web3! But what surprised MetaOasis Lab the most is that we found a young but promising project — Astra: OmniRise.

From a data perspective, Astra has outstanding strengths in all aspects, including product, economic model, and level of decentralization, except for being slightly weak in team and community.

However, what attracted MetaOasis Lab most to Astra is that although it is a young and startup project, it already has a grand and mature vision.

“Compared to other interstellar-themed games, Astra: OmniRise puts more emphasis on the personal growth of the characters, and players will experience the story of the universe from a personal perspective. Additionally, there are world events in the game that require players and the community to vote together to decide the story’s plot. This makes the story more dynamic and unpredictable, and players will have a completely different gaming experience compared to past games”, Astra’s co-founder said.

It is worth mentioning that in Astra, most of the player’s assets are comprised of NFTs, which coincidentally aligns well with the spaceship-themed NFT series previously forged by Epoison Studio under the MetaOasis!

Under the leadership of the expert team at MetaOasis Lab, Epoison Studio and Astra have joined forces. In the future, with Astra Studio’s entry into the MetaOasis platform ecosystem, Astra Studio will achieve NFT sharing and interconnection within MetaOasis.

In some way, it enhances the confidence of deep cooperation between MetaOasis Lab and Astra! MetaOasis expects to have more players driving our spaceship shuttle through the fantastic universe of Astra.

* **Add Value to NFT Assets Explore**
the possibility of NFT MNP(MetaOasis NFT Protocol) integration. With that, the NFTs will be powered and used cross-games. For the NFT games, the more utilities, the higher value.

* **R&D Support**
Integrate Series SDK to solve complicated problems, optimize game theory, tokenomic and NFTassets systems.

* **Marketing Support**
Providing support for cold-start marketing: airdrop event, socialpromotions, AMAs, seasonal or themed NFTs campaign etc.

* **Guilds/ Players Acquisition**
Recommend top guilds for early excellent players, who will build a super reputation rapidly for the games and studios.

Last but not least, I would like to thank all the partners who enthusiastically participated in the SDK and the event that brought MetaOasis and Astra: OmniRise together, and I look forward to more achievements in the field of web3!
