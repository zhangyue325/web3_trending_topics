![](https://img.foresightnews.pro/202303/be6e6ce803ce4db339480e3fc2cb896b?x-oss-process=style/scale70)### An image conveys a multitude of messages

Imagine the following scenarios:

1. You are a Web3 startup founder; a well-known freelancer reaches out to you on Twitter and his portfolio impresses you upon reviewing his work accomplishments. You decide to engage him for his services and he sends you an ENS domain for payment. Because of the prevalence of fake accounts on Twitter, you wish to do a background check to ensure the legitimacy of the Twitter profile, and that the ENS domain actually belongs to the freelancer.
2. You would like to buy a specific domain name that is currently owned by someone else, but you have no idea how to reach out to the owner.
3. You are a huge fan of a particular influencer OR you support a particular profile for a certain cause, and you would like to:  
- Make an anonymous donation to him/her for whatever reason  
- Follow all of their Web3 & Web2 social accounts
You may now do so with Web5.bio — An identity search engine that provides visualization of your Web3 & Web2 IDs, powered by Next.ID’s RelationService. This is a workable example of how users can search for Web3 domain connections.

### About Next.ID

Next.ID is a decentralized identity protocol that integrates Web2 and Web3 identities, offering a comprehensive and verifiable identity management and database for open-source developers and projects to innovate and build dApps on.

Next.ID creates an identity infrastructure that securely aggregates and authenticates users’ identities into a Decentralized Identifier (DID) called Avatar, making it the primary touch point for interfacing with any app or dApp.

Next.ID’s identity Avatars exist independently from Web2 and Web3, using a blockchain-like model to retain data integrity. This allows Next.ID to connect to all Web2 and Web3 platforms, aggregating all identities in a fully-agnostic way, unifying them into one single DID.
