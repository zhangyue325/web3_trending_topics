CIAN, a leading DeFi yield automation and strategy platform, and Matrixport, one of the world’s largest digital assets financial services ecosystem, have partnered to accelerate scalable and expandable institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi).

With the partnership, Matrixport will support CIAN’s infrastructure and dApp, enabling institutional and accredited investors to seamlessly participate in CIAN’s one-stop recursive strategy vault, which taps into top-tier lending protocols such as AAVE and Compound.

Executed by smart contracts, CIAN offers tailored yield strategies and position management. Investors will have access to a fully decentralized architecture targeting optimal transaction routes for specified yield strategies while ensuring transparent fund operations and protection against liquidation risks.

CIAN protocol is a liquid staking derivatives (“LSD”) focused yield strategy platform, where users could earn either through joining algorithmic strategy vaults or through building their own DeFi strategies using CIAN’s advanced automation tools.

CIAN enables LSD holders to benefit from DeFi yield in addition to their staking yield. To the holders of other tokens (eg. BTC, stables etc.), CIAN makes high quality liquid staking yield accessible.
