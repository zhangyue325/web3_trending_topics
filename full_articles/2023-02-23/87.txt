It’s so nice to see you again🌞. We know this is the moment you’ve been waiting for! With the arena gameplay development in progress as planned, Tiny World will provide **a preview of PvP Arena Gameplay Details**🤩. We can barely contain ourselves from sharing them with all of our Tiny Warriors! Certainly, everything depends on the actual content released.❤️

1. **Gameplay Mode 🎮❇️**
* The arena game will be released in **season mode**, **with** **each season lasting 7 days**. Season rankings are settled 🗓️**on Thursday 08:00 AM UTC🗓️**️, and **season rewards are distributed then**.
* In order to provide the freshness of the arena game experience, each season will randomly obtain different **seasonal themes**. Seasonal theme effects may be used to strengthen specific class heroes, or to initially grant all participating heroes additional rare attributes, or even to add extra ranking score rewards for consecutive wins. However, to get the arena game launched as early as possible, the initial seasons will temporarily not launch any seasonal themes.
2. **Participation Conditions 🥷📇**

* To participate in the arena game you require **up to 3 heroes to combat, including maximum 1 for each class.**
* Only heroes **in idle or active status (BOSS/arena status) can fight in combat.** Heroes in the castle combats cannot participate in the arena game at the same time.
* Each player can **challenge 3 times a day for free**, after the free challenges are used up, you can continue to challenge with Arena Tickets. The consumption of Arena Tickets will increase with the cumulative number of challenges for the day. Arena Tickets can be crafted by consuming materials in the workshop.
3. **Tinymon Reset😸🔂**

As an important participant in the arena gameplay, Tinymon can be reset for players to experience more strategic matching gameplay. **After resetting, most of the consumption resources by Tinymon upgrade will be returned** and players can use the returned materials to upgrade other Tinymons.

That’s the preview for this week. Next time, we will have a browse of the combat details and Tinymon body part characteristics, so stay tuned!🤩
