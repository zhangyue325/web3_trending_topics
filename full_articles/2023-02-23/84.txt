iZiSwap is the first concentrated liquidity DEX on BNB Chain with an innovative DL-AMM model. Before the birth of concentrated liquidity DEX, liquidity was distributed uniformly throughout the price curve between 0 and infinity. However, in many pools, most liquidity was never used. On iZiSwap, liquidity is being put to work more efficiently.

iZiSwap aims to help projects bootstrap and manage their own pool and on-chain liquidity transparently and efficiently. Our Double Reward Incentives Campaign will keep on inviting excellent projects to join.
