In February 2023, with the sector rotation during the Chinese New Year, when lamenting that the sorrows and joys of human beings are not interlinked, the bear market has also unknowingly accompanied the Web3 co-builders for about a year.

“A bull market is for making money, and a bear market is suitable for doing things.” Every project party that gathers together to keep warm said so. However, among the user groups of Web3 who are speculators, you can see many project parties slowed down either adjusting or lying on the ground after finishing several rounds of The Twitter Space Discussions that were filled with robot audiences.

“Financing or BD is as difficult as hell, and there are just a few responses in activities, only this tweet left to comfort me.” Not only one project party has similar feelings. In a bear market, it is not as easy as imagined to persevere simply by relying on predictive ability and willpower. It may still require some sense of faith and a steady rhythm.

Valentine’s Day on February 14th is the first festival to be celebrated since the new year in 2023. Some project parties were ready to start their activities at this time and were busy preparing for the first event of the new year. Daren Market is also one of them. This Valentine’s Day, Daren Market has launched a grand 7-day Valentine’s Day lucky draw activity.

On February 20th, Daren Market announced the successful closing of the 7-day Valentine’s Day Sweepstakes on Twitter. From February 14th to February 20th, the Sweepstakes twitter had a total of 8.5 million views, 126 forwarding times, and a total of 47,000 users visited the sweepstakes on the Daren platform, all 12,000 draw chances were used up, and 420 valuable prizes were shared.

It can be seen from the poster of the event that Daren Market has joined forces with many co-hosts for this sweepstakes and also attracted a lot of sponsors. According to the LOGO on the poster, 30+ co-hosts, and 15 sponsors were involved.

It is worth noting that the sweepstakes on the Daren Market platform is not open to all comers, but has a clear participation threshold. You need to log in to the platform and hold a specific NFT in your wallet to participate in the event. This is also one of the functions of the Daren platform, which can automatically check the NFT holdings in the user’s wallet and match specific functions and permissions.

It is still a risky behavior to set a high participation threshold for to C-side activities. After all, it is not an easy task to acquire customers for Web3. At present, Web3 does not have a relatively standardized and process-based approach to acquiring customers. Most of the project parties use some curation platforms to hold activities to attract traffic, even so, there are many robot users mixed in. For most activities, having traffic is already hard. While setting a threshold may reduce the popularity, it has a strong screening effect.

Taking all of these problems together, Daren’s way of promoting this event is worthy of consideration.

According to Daren Market’s Twitter, the core participation traffic of this event is attracted by co-hosts’ Twitter forwarding, no paid KOL has been spotted to help promote it. However, we can see a clever way of playing. Daren took advantage of the threshold for event participation, applying participation qualifications to achieve user fission. Most co-hosts used official Twitter to do the sweepstakes and won the prize. Even if users do not meet the threshold, they will be given a free chance which attracts a large number of onlookers.

Therefore, it can be roughly estimated that the cost of this 50,000 people participated event only include the time spent on some posters, cooperation, and function development. From this perspective, it is indeed a campaign with a very high ROI.

A top entrepreneur and investor in China once said that only by solving problems without spending money can be called achievement. It is a kind of resource curse when it is all about money.

Daren Market, as an early project that has not yet been publicly funded, in the Web3 bear market where customer acquisition is difficult and precision is low, attracts huge audiences with its ingenious gameplay with zero cost by using Twitter as a lever for promoting. It is no doubt a successful case in terms of activity design and conversion effect.

According to the core members of Daren Market, sweepstakes is not the first time to use. Including this Valentine, it has been tried 3 times, and traffic for each of these events has exceeded 10,000. Sweepstake is proven to be functional in activating the project and the community. In the future, a sweepstake is not only for the platform’s own use but also as a tool for store drainage that can directly provide to the project parties who have settled on the platform. Everyone can use this tool for traffic attracting.

Finally, the essence of bulls and bears is the industry cycle, just ebb and flow. We’ve all heard the saying that you don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out. Many projects that raised funds in the bull market were eliminated when the bear market came. On the contrary, we can see some inconspicuous project parties, with a long-term attitude, building across the bull and bear.

Within an industry, those who are most often paid attention to by everyone are the successful and lucky ones. However, in the end, those who get the dividends of the cycle are often those who have been keeping their position at the poker table. These crews are always becoming the industry’s fundamental cornerstone ultimately.
