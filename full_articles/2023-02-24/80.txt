The first UR Hero in the final round of auctions was —**Alexander, 👑King of Macedonia**. However, due to the impact of the launch of Tiny Lord 2.0 which led to a high system load — some players failed to bid at the last moment and unfortunately missed the auction of UR hero —**Alexander**. In response to the community feedback, we gave our warriors another chance to bid for UR hero —**Alexander** in the 2️⃣4️⃣th week.

Meanwhile, in order to reduce the system load and continuously optimize the playing experience, the End Time of each round will be adjusted from 08:00 AM UTC every Thursday to 🗓️**08:00 AM UTC every Wednesday**🗓️. This will commence starting from the 2️⃣4️⃣th week of UR auction.

If you missed your last chance at royalty this time, don’t worry. Here the great UR Hero in the final round of auctions — **Alexander, 👑King of Macedonia** has been released for players to [bid on](https://app.tinyworlds.io/mysterybox/auction)🥳. What are you waiting for? Please join us in the auction for this great chance…🙋
