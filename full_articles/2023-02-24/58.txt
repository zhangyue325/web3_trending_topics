Let’s have our guest introduce themselves and as well their roles respective projects. Let’s start with Shaun

And in terms of NFT Market, I think that NF T’s are decoupling can beat,  
especially in Xero, kind of own narratives. And recently, we seen a really strong blogger narrative, and it attracted a lot of money or not detract it, I would say more subtracted and generated a lot of money. Via AirDrop, and we’ll see some new players come over there. And AirDrop money is also affecting positively price of collections as AirDrop money is used to trade and pump some floors. So all in all, I would say I’m pretty  
bullish in short term, I mean, a couple of following months. But all in all for this year, I think we won’t see any dramatic change of market situation. And I’m not speaking about new heights.  
And as for NFT market, like in a ledger is solving liquidity issues for NFT market. And we’re strongly focused on gameplay masters, so not on the on profile picture project. And I think that game-fi is, could be very strong driver of the industry, the next cycle. So a lot of projects got big investments, probably in 2020 2021. And it takes a  
pretty long time to build a plus projects usually takes like, five years or so. So it means that in during late this year, or next year, we’ll see some betters and I think that market will start shifting from kind of profile picture world to some better utilities, in game items, etc.

We do see the money flowing back into NF Ts, causing NFT’s to be general for price to rise. But what I do feel personally is that it feels a little inflated, in a sense that currently there’s a lot of wash trade going on, just to farm this Blur drop, because well, season one is just over, everyone has seen the potential of this blur airdrop, and everyone has started farming for the blue airdrop up to the season two, and therefore they’re just washed trading a lot. And without actual money flowing into the web ecosystem, and specifically into NF T’s in general. I feel that this trend is not sustainable. And we’re gonna have a lot of people bagholding and therefore  
Why I personally feel is that we should be looking at projects that are actually providing real value to holders. And people benefiting from all this from holding the NFTs and not just like riding on the wave and end up holding over-expensive JPEGs.

Because we saw the hype in the last Bull Run is a lot of JPEG PFPs. As more projects developed, we will see a lot more gamefi related and art collectibles, I think that will give value.

So especially I guess, with the more varieties coming andwhat we call fair launch. I think that will give a lot more and not just the element of back holding and who’s going to be the last to hold the bags when the music ends.   
But you know, like having having, really the way to have memberships into communities. You know, that is also phygital. Not just collectibles. But also, if I play a game and spent even up to 10,000 bucks on it. When I exited the game, I didn’t get anything back. But I think you know, with this NFT as part of the game, people can be able to exit the investments in a game or do not line or making an earning, but at least you know, at least for me, in this case, if I spent 10 grand, even getting like 30% back is bonus and so I think that will take another two to three runs. But I am seeing the trend on it now.

Oh, okay. Yeah, since the very beginning end of the year, we have witnessed multiple bullish signals, we are creating a more friendly macro environment like the fad is slowing down its pace to raise the interest rates. Hong Kong better embracing the crypto cryptocurrency industry. Also the blockchain ecosystem itself is going smoothly, both in terms of its innovative technology and better compliance management. So we are also constantly familiarized with new hotspots like the eye catching ETH upgrades. And it’s noticeable that various countries and regions are turning more of their attention towards blockchain. So overall, I believe we are backing into a promising future. And as the market is warming up, I think the NFT sector and the gaming sector are booming to like the blur boom recently. So I’m rather optimistic about that. Thank you.

So I think the bull run two years, we look at a lot of gaming, gaming always be part of it, because that’s something that will draw in the most users over time. But that’s going to be for non gaming nfts, as long as their community they can do anything, right.  
I foresee that this might be even applicable for communities looking to bootstrap, a community defined, right. As long as , people buy into that, and is actually the token response. I think that could be anything, gaming is the easiest, but because for that product, if you want to have a better quality kind of game, devs may not be game developers as well. So I think the SS, the communities for NFS matures, and they have been more sound expectation.  
And then they really bite into projects, believing in the roadmap, I will say that going to be a lot more products, they’re going to build not just on games and collectibles, utility community, even for this year I think on the last year in a bear market, we see a lot of phygital events as well, that’s organized by NFT, communities, ventures, that types of gatherings that bring people together. So that kind of development is going to definitely grow over time.

And games are just a start. Right. So I think, I think having said that, there’s there’s two things that you need to consider, because some projects will build a game or something for the sake of of that, right. And it only serves their community, which is fine. But you know,  
is that that might be a bit short term. So over time, the champions will stay and are those that has a greater ability to attract not just the community by continuing to grow as the project iterates into something else and then have a life on its own. Right. So I think for the blue chip projects for NF T’s they have all, you know, the subject to move into a brand, not just a game, you know, even just about licensing with the NF T’s. And I think there was an element of that in the board. It’s the ba ba YC community. So I think there’s something interesting that may play out over time.

Also, diversified NFT’s can serve as a tool to categorize users to into different levels or sections according to their interests. But there’s one problem that’s currently what to a large extent attracts users to NF T’s in games maybe is that they can can economic benefits and expectations. I think that’s maybe the games have to improve their interesting mechanisms to to introduce more users into it.

Shaun, Could you could you share more about like, how do you see this and that the usage of NFT grow over time? Because I understand that for pudgy penguins, there is actually there is actually some development on that front. I saw on your Twitter that here is the penguin that is dancing around. How do you see NFT grow in in other directions other than gaming and NFT-Fi?

And then people realize that, hey, I want my progress to be saved. I want to progress over time. So we see the next evolution of games being games like Runescape, like Maplestory, in which you get to save your progress and move forward. The next time you log in, but we’ve web3. I see as more of a lot of the ownership of the game assets. Such that I believe, I believe it was with at least will say that, like I’m able to exit if let’s say I choose not to play this game, it’s not so much of I want to profit from it. And this is where I feel a lot of work web3 games currently has done the reverse.

Like I shouldn’t be able to earn a living I’ll make a living off playing games because logically doesn’t make sense. There isn’t any real world value created to justify you making a living off playing games. Of course, no shit show that Esports players because those are entertainment in its own form. But me as an everyday player, I shouldn’t be able to earn a living off gaming in general. So I do believe that the next stage in which NFT games or web three games are going to develop is that the game should be front loaded. And the tokenomics of it like for you to benefit of it is going to be back loaded. So it’s like a little incentive like hey, if I want to sell my account, I no longer have to do it illegally in a way, but I’m I am able to get rewarded for my time because there is value created for another individual who sees value in the asset that you have found. So this is regards to the game fi sort of things. But as for how the NFT space is going to evolve. Personally, I do feel that as an industry, we are looking at the whole equation wrongly, we see NFS as the beginning of the whole project. But when we look at it the other way, we look at the brand as brand awareness first. And then we start trickling down, we can do other things like physical much games, or really just the branding itself.

And this is something that I do feel that the budget penguin team, it’s doing really well, like we are actually doing the inverse. Instead of focusing so much on the NSPS, we are actually expanding the brand itself, the brand awareness out there, getting out our brand, on Instagram, on Twitter, such that the content is not directly linked to the value of the NFL is. So it’s really getting on brand awareness, making people recognize your brand, your brand assets, eventually, the NFT holders do benefit from the brand awareness going up. And the value does roll back to the origin of holders. Because if you look at it, NFT’s are religious, like your IPO for traditional companies, you’re investing in that company. And using these funds, that company is creating more value to get other people into the ecosystem. So yeah, these are just some of the thoughts that I had through this whole discussion.

Alright. I think that brings us to to the last part of the AMA and and I think there’s something that we all look forward to. Right. Could you let us know what’s, what are some exciting things we can expect from the projects that you guys represent for the next couple of months? Since we end with Shaun, let’s go with Poerain.

So those from his blog, AirDrop, it means that all the participants of monopole campaign will be also eligible for ledger token AirDrop in the future. And we’re building really hard for the last almost six months and believes it hmm. For NF T’s is really the great liquidity solution. So the things that we prepared is widely is for all the listeners of this ama to get to monopoly the campaign to Hayden, if you do not mind mascot to be in a link for Google form, so our listeners could get it could get access. And as for not so near future letter, we’re working on beige, NFTs on finalizing tokenomics. And yeah, almost all our forces are called on the main net, where we would like to go live in following plans as soon as possible. So yeah, we’ll be happy for you to test our product and share feedback. Thank you.

With a few partners, I think that’s something to look forward to. And then as well as we will be fundraising for the next round, which is the PvP and in game that’s formed for engagement entertainment for glory games.

And as for the pudgy Penguin side of things, is going to be an exciting year for us. So we do have toys on the roadmap very, is going to be out really, really soon. Sooner than you expect. We actually just released we went public with our news that we actually had a collaboration with retail monster, which is a pretty big brand in in the European and the western side of the US. So it’s going to be an exciting year. Be it for pudgy penguins or for headquarters.
