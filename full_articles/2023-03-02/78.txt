Tiny World released a preview of **PvP Arena Gameplay Details** last week. We provided information about the arena gameplay mode, participation conditions, and Tinymon’s reset gameplay. If you haven’t read it yet, be sure to read 👉[**HERE**](https://medium.com/@tinyworld.gamefi/pvp-arena-gameplay-preview-1-3-db36ab403491) before reading this post. This week, we will go over the **specifics of the arena combat**.

If you defeat an opponent with a higher score than you, you will be rewarded with more points.

However, there is a risk in challenging a high-scoring opponent because the opponent may be more powerful. Before challenging an opponent, you can check their profile to learn their skill and team set-up.

If you find that all 3 opponents are too powerful, you can spend crystals to refresh for a new batch of potentially weaker opponents.

In the arena, **choosing the right hero position and Tinymon characteristics** is crucial✅. To achieve the optimal strategy, you can adjust the characteristics of Tinymon that the heroes carry based on the opponent’s hero position and attributes.

For example, if the opponent’s middle position is a hero with high defense, you can choose a Tinymon with the “penetration” characteristic to reduce the opponent’s defense ability and increase your damage. Similarly, if the opponent is a high-attack, fragile hero, you can choose a Tinymon with high morale to increase your attack speed and quickly defeat the opponent.

In addition, the 3 hero positions can be freely adjusted and combined with different Tinymon skills to have more strategic combinations.

In arena battles, **luck and morale** are both antagonistic attributes⚙️. **Luck attribute** will affect the accuracy and critical hit rate of each attack. **High morale attributes** will make heroes launch attacks earlier and increase all attack damage.

All Tinymon characteristics will only take effect in Arena combats, and Tinymon characteristic effects are as follows:
