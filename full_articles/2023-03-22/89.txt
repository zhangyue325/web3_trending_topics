ETH 2.0 can now use BLS signatures, and REI Network is also developing the BLS signature algorithm, which will be updated to the network in the next hard fork. This article introduces the functions and advantages of the BLS signature algorithm, and what improvements will it bring to REI Network deeply.

### Purpose of BLS signature algorithm

The most frequent adoption of BLS is m-n multiple transactions in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. A user can ask his wallet for m-of-n addresses and get a single address and a shared list of keys. Afterward, it distributes the “key share” to different places (computers or hardware wallets). Wallets don’t store these “key shares”, otherwise all of them would be meaningless.

The generated address is internally just the public key of the original key (and is no longer known). Furthermore, the address is indistinguishable from a normal 1–1BLS address, which means that it is impossible for anyone to know that this is actually an m-n multisig, nor how many keys are involved or how many shares are required to recover the keys.

In this way, no special handling is required for m-n multi-transactions, because internally, verifying a simple signed transaction requires exactly the same verification (e.g. CHECKKBLSSIG).

Currently, ECDSA-based m-n budgets require m public keys and m signatures as part of the transaction, which can easily result in several kB on-chain, thereby damaging its scalability.

Additionally, ECDSA leaks information about the keys used to sign transactions. But if BLS-based threshold signatures are used, the size of the budget is fixed (eg, 32 bytes), which is independent of the values ​​of m and n, and there is no privacy leak.

### Unique advantages of BLS signature algorithm

Among the signature algorithms, BLS has some unique properties, which are also the unique advantages of the BLS signature algorithm.

Using BLS, all types of primitives (private keys, public keys, signatures) can be aggregated, and the result is always another valid primitive.

For example, if two keys are aggregated, the result is a new valid key. If two corresponding public keys of a key are aggregated, the result will be a new public key that matches the public keys of the previously aggregated keys.

If two signatures were created using the two previously aggregated keys and the same hash, the new signature will also be verified against the aggregated public key. Already aggregated primitives can be further aggregated, independent of the order of aggregation.

BLS signature is unique and deterministic. This means that for any given public key and message pair, there is only one valid signature, and it is impossible for two different signatures to verify the same public key and message.

### The Significance of BLS Signature Algorithm to REI Network

The advantages of the BLS signature algorithm are:

1) No random number generator is required, all signatures in the block can be aggregated into one;

2) It is easy to implement m-n multi-signature, and can also avoid redundant communication between signers;

3) The length of the signature is shorter (the signature is one point on the elliptic curve instead of two), which is 1/2 of Schnorr or ECDSA.

The next update of REI Network will use the BLS signature for the consensus level of the block, which will help reduce the size of the block header, reduce the storage space of the validator, and improve the efficiency of the validator operation.
