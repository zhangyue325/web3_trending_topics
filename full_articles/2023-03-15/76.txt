Through this partnership, you can explore the Lens protocol’s most active users on Firefly, with a selection of the top 5,000, including over 190 TopScore NFT holders and for those who possess the special “Your 2022 Wrapped on Lens” NFT, eligible profiles will be distinguished with a unique checkmark, providing additional authentication for these users.

Firefly also offers access to a combination of off-chain and on-chain content, allowing for a more comprehensive browsing experience. With the assistance of TopScore, finding compatible and engaged users within the Lens ecosystem on Firefly has never been easier.

This partnership will appeal to a wider user base and help users exploring Web3. We look forward to observing how it will evolve into a mutually rewarding meaningful association.

### **Why choose TopScore?**

Topscore is a revolutionary product that aims to bring changes in the current scenario of data and AI monopoly by large organizations. Our goal is to break this monopoly and democratize access to advanced algorithms and AI models, making it accessible to the general public. We believe that individuals should have the right to their personal data and the freedom to express themselves creatively, and we aim to promote this through our product. By popularizing the use of AI and Web3 technology, we hope to improve people’s efficiency and productivity, and contribute to the development of a creative economy.

TopScore provides a Web3 social score that measures one’s social activity on decentralized platforms. It is a social-graph based metric used to rank users with their influence, appeal and contributions in the community, such as creating and promoting contents or participating in discussions. TopScore can be used by decentralized social networks to incentivize social activities and reward active users.

For Lens users, TopScore gives a measure of social reputation mainly from the following 6 dimensions:

1. Influence (Follow relationship),
2. Campaign (Topic maker),
3. Engagement (Social activist),
4. Creation (Content creator),
5. Collection (Content collector),
6. Curation (Referral & Promote).
